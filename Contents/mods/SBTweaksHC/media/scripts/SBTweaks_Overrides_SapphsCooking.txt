    /*  No amount over "override: true" and recipe renaming seems to allow me to overwrite the
        recipe from Sapph Cooking.  Multiple reports on developer forums of bugs since 41.65 breaking
        the override functionality.  This isn't tragic enough to require us to write a loop through every
        recipe on load and find the original and then try to hide it. BEcause again the Disable() routine is broken.
        Instead, I've added a "_Fixed" recipe, then using Translate/EN renamed the old recipe to "Broken do not use"
        It's ugly in the Menu, but it works, so good enough. Not worth any more effort. You now keep the Mortar Pestle
